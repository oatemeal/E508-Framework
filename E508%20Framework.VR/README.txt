This is the framework template for Error 508 Loop Detected Missions.
When creating a mission select the terrain you want to use and save a blank mission with your mission name.

Once done you should "Merge" the framework mission into your own in the "File" Menu.
This will copy over all of the units in the recommended organisation and a default US loadout.

Following this locate your mission folder and copy over all of the files except the "mission.sqm" file.
This will then give you all of the default AI Skill, Briefing Template and the Addon Settins template.

When editing loadouts for soldiers try to keep the same number of medical/ammo count for balance.
Once your mission is complete edit the briefing file and add a picture to replace the loadscreen.paa file, message me for help if needed in this bit.
